### Berin's sketch tools

Hi, my name is Bernardo, aka Berin, and in this repo you'll find the auxiliar functions and tools I've built to make my daily work with Processing easier. Welcome!

Since this is for my personal usage and my personal taste, the current methods signatures, parameters and results can change in the future if I can find out newer and more comprehensive implementations. So, please, use this as a style guide and not as a framework. If you want to take a look on what I've been creating using Python and Processing, please be welcome to access [my sketches' page](https://berinhard.github.io/sketches/).

Please, free to [contact me](mailto:bernardoxhc@gmail.com) regarding licenses to use my work, teaching opportunities, consulting or other projects.
